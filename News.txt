Notable changes for QuantLib 1.0:

PORTABILITY

- Fixes for x64 Visual Studio compilation (thanks to Craig Miller.)

- Enabled language extensions in Visual Studio projects.

- Prevented make errors with older shells (thanks to Walter Eaves.)

DATE/TIME

- Changes to end-of-month adjustment. In a schedule, the Unadjusted
  convention now supersedes a non-null calendar and causes dates to
  roll on the unadjusted end of month (possibly a holiday.)

- Added new date-generation rule for CDS (thanks to Jose Aparicio.)

- Fix for CDS fair-upfront calculation (thanks to Jose Aparicio.)
  Previously, fair-upfront calculation required a non-null upfront
  to begin with. This is no longer the case.

INSTRUMENTS

- Fixed discounting of dividends on convertible-bond grid (thanks to
  Benoit Houzelle and Samuel Lerouge.)

CASH FLOWS

- A number of CashFlows methods now return a meaningful result even
  if the passed leg is empty.

PROCESSES

- Changed default discretization for Heston process.  The new
  default (giving a better performance) is quadratic exponential
  with Martingale correction.

TERM STRUCTURES

- Removed ambiguous parRate member functions from YieldTermStructure
  interface.

EXAMPLES

- Added market-model example.

EXPERIMENTAL FOLDER

The ql/experimental folder contains code which is still not fully
integrated with the library or even fully tested, but is released in
order to get user feedback.  Experimental classes are considered
unstable; their interfaces might change in future releases.
New contributions for this release were:

- Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm for basket products including coupon
  payments (thanks to Andrea Odetti;)

- added sparse incomplete LU preconditioner for 2D finite-difference
  models (thanks to Ralph Schreyer.)
